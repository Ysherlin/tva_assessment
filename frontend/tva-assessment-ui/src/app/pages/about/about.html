  <h2>About This Application</h2>

  <div class="about-panel">

    <p>
      This application was built as part of a technical assessment to demonstrate
      full-stack development skills using modern technologies and best practices.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <p>
      The goal of the application is to manage <strong>persons</strong>,
      their <strong>accounts</strong>, and related <strong>transactions</strong>,
      while enforcing realistic business rules such as account status and
      transaction validation.
    </p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> .NET 8 Web API</li>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Angular (Standalone Components)</li>
      <li><strong>ORM:</strong> Entity Framework Core</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQL Server</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design Approach</h3>

    <p>
      The solution follows clean separation of concerns, with clear boundaries
      between controllers, services, repositories, and domain entities.
      Business rules are enforced in the application layer, and the frontend
      mirrors those rules to provide a consistent user experience.
